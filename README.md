## Background

Beks is a data scientist who has been working with machine learning and neural networks for five years. She recently completed a boot camp to enhance her skills and is now ready to use her knowledge to help a foundation predict where to make investments. She has been provided with a dataset from Alphabet Soup's business team, which contains information on more than 34,000 applicants. Beks's goal is to use the features in this dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if Alphabet Soup funds them. This classifier will be an essential tool for the foundation to make informed decisions about where to allocate resources and support to maximize the impact of their investments.
